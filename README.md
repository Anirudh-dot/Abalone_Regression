Abalone Regression With Pycaret


Abstract:

This project explores the application of machine learning to predict the age of abalone using PyCaret, a low-code library for automating machine learning workflows. The dataset consists of 4,177 samples with physical measurements and weights of abalones, with the target variable, age, derived from the number of shell rings plus a biological constant (1.5). PyCaret was utilized to preprocess the data, compare multiple regression models, and finalize the best-performing model. The comparison of models revealed that a Gradient Boosting Regressor outperformed others with a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 4.23 on unseen data. The finalized model demonstrated robust performance in predicting abalone age, providing a reliable and efficient approach to estimating the lifespan of these marine organisms. This study highlights the capability of low-code machine learning tools like PyCaret in simplifying and accelerating predictive modeling tasks across diverse applications.
